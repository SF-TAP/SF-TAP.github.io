## Loopback7 Interface

The loopback7 interfaces provided by the SF-TAP flow abstractor is a special interface for injecting application flows into the SF-TAP flow abstractor.
This interfaces is helpful for handling encapsulated flows.
For example, HTTP proxies allow HTTP clients to use HTTP tunneling by CONNECT method.
Thus, actual flows, such as SSL/TLS, are encapsulated by HTTP protocol
when using a HTTP proxy.
In this case, the SF-TAP flow abstractor does not properly work because of
the encapsulation.

In order to handle encapsulated flows properly,
the encapsulated flows must be encapsulated and re-injected to the
SF-TAP flow abstractor.
The re-injecting is achieved by using the loopback7 interface.
In this document, we show how to use the loopback7 intefrcace for HTTP proxy.
